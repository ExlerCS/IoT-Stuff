# IoT-Stuff
Some IoT projects, probably all NodeMCU based.

I'll add more as I make them.

## [LEDBulbRemote](https://github.com/tkmarsh/IoT-LEDBulbRemote)
Controls IR LED bulbs, light strips and just about anything that uses that generic remote.
Useful for intergrating cheap LED bulbs and strip lighting into smart home systems.

## [Cabinet](https://github.com/tkmarsh/IoT-Cabinet)
Controls the locking mechanism on a cabinet, simple and not at all secure, but still cool.
